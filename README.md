# profesh
A tool for scrubbing personal tweets and retweeting professional ones  
  
### Getting Started  
1. Log into the account you wish to use as your "professional" twitter account.  
2. Go to the (https://apps.twitter.com)[Twitter Applications page] and click 'Create New App.'  
   Give your application a name, a description, and a website link. I just linked back to my Github.
3. Generate your consumer keys, and then give token access. Keep these keys secret!  
   Paste them into the appropriate lines in the `twitter_keys.py` file.
